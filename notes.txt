 check the question is under which concept 
 
 1-#diiferace between while an for loop is that in while loop we have to define
  the condition and in for loop we have to define the range
  -number of differences are known in for and unknown in while


2-#int() is type casting function it takes input as string and converts it to integer

3-#// returns integer value even if the result is float

4-#map functoin is used to take input from two or more than two variables
#map fuction have three args- datatype,input(),split()
#split() function is used to split the input values by default its space
#we can also split by comma or any other character by passing that character in split function

5-#in lists the adresses of the elements are kept in the memory where as in arrays the elements are kept in the memory
6-lists are the ordered collections of any datatype
  lists syntax-l=input("enter the number of elements).split()

               var=list(map(int,input().split()))

               var=[]
               for i in range(3):
                  e=int(input())
                  var.append(e)
7-.extend in lists is used for add a complete list to a list
   if we added a single element it will break that single element and add it into the list
   i.e var.extend(45) - output will have list with 2 added elements 4,5

8-.remove[i]
  .pop()
  .clear() - it is used to clear the list.
  .index(val) - returns the index of the element.
  .count(val) - returns the number of times the element is present.
  .copy() - returns copy of the list.
  .sort() - sorts the list if ascending order then give arguement as.
  .reverse() - reverse the elements of the list.

9-slicing
  vae[start:stop:step]

10- # To get unique values, we can convert the list to a set.
    # A set is a data structure that only stores unique elements.
    # If you need the result as a list again, you can convert it back.

11-- Lists are ordered, mutable collections that allow duplicate elements of any data type.
   - Sets are unordered, mutable collections that only store unique elements.
   - Arrays are ordered, mutable collections that typically store elements of 
    the same data type for memory efficiency.
   note : "Unordered" means there is no guaranteed sequence for the elements.
           You cannot refer to an element by its position or index

12-for prime numbers checking
      for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True     

13-Time Complexity
  how many steps the code will take to execute
  worst case-Big O 
  for loop - O(n^a)  a-number of for loops
      if any for loop having the highest time complexity then it is considered as the time complexity of that program
  sorting-O(nlogn)
  Reccursion-O(2^n) or O(2^n)
  Binary Search- O(logn)

14- unordered,changable key value pairs
    syntx{key:value}
    dictionary methods:
     .get(key)-returns the value
     .update(key:value)-updates the value(u can also give more than one)
     .copy()-returns the copy of the dictionary
     .clear()-clears the dictionary
     .keys()-returns the keys of the dictionary
     .values()-returns the values of the dictionary
     .items()-returns all the key value pairs of the dictionary
     .pop(key)-removes the key value pair
     .popitem()-removes the last key value pair and return it as a tuple

15-#numer of time a value is ocuuring in a list
   #hasing - frequency table for a given list of finte and small values
    #hashing is very easy to implement using dictionary in python
